Filter tweets with an LLM. Currently works with Claude only.

I haven't published this on the Chrome store, to run locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
5. The extension should now appear in your Chrome toolbar
